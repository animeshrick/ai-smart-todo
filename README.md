Futute Task

1. Summarization for Long Descriptions:
   
    Problem: People paste long notes in descriptions.
    Solution: Auto-generate a short title with Hugging Face summarizers (bart-large-cnn or t5-small).
    Example: Description: “Prepare slides for Monday’s meeting with HR about new leave policies.” → Title suggestion: “Slides for HR meeting.”

3. Similar Task Recommendations:
   
    Problem: Repeated tasks (e.g. groceries).
    Solution: Use embeddings to find past similar tasks.
    How: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (free, small model).
Suggest: “This looks like your usual Grocery List — want to re-use tags/due date?”

3.Smart Scheduling:
    Use heuristics or ML to suggest best times to work on tasks.
    Example: “You finish writing tasks faster in the evening — schedule this essay after 8 PM?”
    Start with simple rules + user history, can later train a recommender.
